Understanding bind() with Your Example
The Core Problem
In JavaScript, when you pass a method to an event listener, this loses its context. Without .bind(this), this inside handleClick() would refer to the button element, not your React class instance.

Simple Definition
bind(this) glues your method to a specific object — it creates a new function where this always refers to what you tell it to.
