# Synchronous and Asynchronous Javascript Fundamentals
## Synchronous Programming
Synchronous programming is a programming paradigm where tasks are executed sequentially, meaning that each task must complete before the next one begins. In JavaScript, this is the default behavior for most operations.

## Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows a program to perform tasks without blocking the main thread of execution. In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is commonly used for tasks such as making network requests, reading files, and handling user input.

### Key Concepts
1. **Callbacks**: Functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after a certain task is completed.
2. **Promises**: Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
3. **Async/Await**: Syntactic sugar built on top of Promises that allows for writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous manner.
